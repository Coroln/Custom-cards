The script is intended to create a bunch of lua files with allready existing comments and the initial function to aid in creating a custom card deck.
It is not supposed to be a stand alone script creator who automatically puts everything in order for a custom card to work
Why? Because I hassled a lot with copying existing files and renaming them with F2 or creating a lot of them god knows how, so I consulted with python, the language I use at university

Q&A:
Q - Am I allowed to change/add stuff to the python code?
A - Only by consulting with me (creasycat) first, I dont want anybody medeling with a script running on my kernel without a check and balance system in place

Q - How am I supposed to trust you with the code then?
A - See for yourself before executing it, everythings documented in there

Q - no real questions yet
A - I can't do anything about this
